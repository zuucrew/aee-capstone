"""
Friendly labels for the chain-of-thought timeline.

Maps internal stage / tool identifiers to human-readable strings the
UI shows users while their request is in flight. Keeps the wording
in one place so the chain-of-thought never says "lookup_patient" but
"Looking up your appointments in the CRM".
