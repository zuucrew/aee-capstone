"""
FastAPI application for the Nawaloka Health Assistant.

Architecture:
    Sync HTTP contract · async internals · CAG short-circuit for common
    queries · full LangGraph agent on cache miss · background cache writes.

Endpoints (mounted from ``routers/`` and ``routers/tools/``):

    POST  /chat                          — main conversational endpoint
    POST  /chat/reset                    — clear session ST memory
    GET   /sessions/{sid}/turns          — debug: dump recent ST turns
    GET   /health, /ready, /config       — system status

    POST  /tools/crm/*                   — 5 CRM actions
    POST  /tools/rag/search              — internal KB retrieval
    GET   /tools/rag/stats               — RAG cache stats
    POST  /tools/web_search              — Tavily real-time search
    POST  /tools/cag/{get,set,clear}     — semantic cache CRUD
    GET   /tools/cag/stats
    POST  /tools/memory/{recall,store_fact,distill}
    GET   /tools/memory/facts/{user_id}
    POST  /tools/crawl                   — Playwright BFS crawl
